# Overview

- When suggesting any shell command that relies on environment variables or secrets, never run it directly.
- Instead, always output the command wrapped in op run --env-file=.env.secret -- … (or my preferred env file) and treat it as something I will run manually.
- If you need to run a command yourself in Agent mode, also use this wrapping.
- This does not apply to commands that call the hasura `ddn` cli within the `./hasur` subdirectory
