description: Encourages cursor to avoid spinning up new terminals when an existing one will do just fine

# Overview

- Always try to reuse the most recently used terminal in Cursor for all commands.
- If a new terminal is ever opened or a command fails with an authentication / 1Password / missing‑env error, do not assume the command or code is wrong.
- In those cases, pause executing commands and tell me explicitly:
  - that a new terminal was opened or secrets are missing;
  - that I should sign in to 1Password (e.g. eval "$(op signin …)");
  - and then ask me to confirm when I’m done before retrying.
